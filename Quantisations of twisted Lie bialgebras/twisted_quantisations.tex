        Let $\a^+$ be a topological Lie bialgebra, say determined by a Manin triple $(\a, \a^+, \a^-)$, that is twisted invariantly by an automorphism $\vartheta \in \Aut_{\LA}(\a)$. Since $\a \cong \Dr(\a^+)$ and since quantisation commutes with duality and doubling (see \cite{enriquez_geer_compatibility_of_etingof_kazhdan_quantisation_with_duality_and_doubling}), we have:
            $$\calU_{\hbar}(\a) \cong \Dr( \calU_{\hbar}(\a^+) )$$
        with the RHS denoting the quantum double, and so there is a topological Hopf algebra embedding $\calU_{\hbar}(\a^+) \hookrightarrow \calU_{\hbar}(\a)$. Suppose further, that $\a^+$ has a quasi-triangular classical r-matrix $\calr$, which becomes a quantum R-matrix $\calR_{\hbar}$ for $\calU_{\hbar}(\a^+)$.}
