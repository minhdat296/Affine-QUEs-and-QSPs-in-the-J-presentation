        It is known that the restriction $\delta|_{\g'}$ is a Lie sub-bialgebra structure on the derivation-less affine Lie algebras, which coincides with the derived subalgebra $\g'$. The pseudo-fixed-point subalgebras $\k' = \k \cap \g'$ thus have structures of Lie coideals of $(\g', \delta|_{\g'})$. One of Lie coideal structures should agree with the classical limits of the twisted $q$-Yangians with centres, say $\calU_q(\g', \vartheta)$, from \cite{molev_ragoucy_sorba_twisted_q_yangians_type_A}, and this is to be expected, as these twisted $q$-Yangians with centres are coideal subalgebras of the quantum affine algebra $\calU_q(\g')$. The centre-less twisted $q$-Yangians $\calU_q(\Loop \bar{\g}, \vartheta)$ is obtained as the quotient of $\calU_q(\g', \vartheta)$ by the ideal generated by $\sklyanindet = 1$, so their classical limits should be the image of $\k'$ under the canonical quotient map:
            $$\g' \to \Loop \bar{\g}$$
        obtained by identifying $\Loop \bar{\g} \cong \g'/\bbk \level$. Note that $\Loop \bar{\g}$ is well-defined as a quotient Lie bialgebra induced by $\delta|_{\g'}$, and this is because $\delta(\level) = 0$, and so $\bbk \level \subset \g'$ is a Lie bi-ideal.
        \\
        Onsager algebras are special cases of classical limits of twisted $q$-Yangians.}
