\section{Twists and the Belavin-Drinfeld classification}
    In this section, we investigate whether our twisting procedure respects the Belavin-Drinfeld classification. In particular, we would like to make the case, that an elliptic (respectively, trigonometric or rational) Lie-bialgebraic structure will remain elliptic (respectively, trigonometric or rational) after twisting.
