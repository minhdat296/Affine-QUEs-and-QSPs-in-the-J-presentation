28/09/2025: I found out today that integrable contragredient Lie algebras are actually the same as symmetrisable Kac-Moody algebras. This simplifies a lot of the arguments that I was in the process of writing down, so I ended up deleting and rewriting a significant portion. Originally, I was going to define and study the properties of twisted Manin triples for as general of a class of Lie algebras as I can, which I thought was going to be the class of triangular-decomposable Lie algebras. However, I was not sure how to derive generators and relations for pseudo-fixed-point subalgebras at that level of generality led me to narrow my focus down to contragredient Lie algebras. Then, I wanted to define automorphisms of types I and II in terms of whether they lie within the orbit of a Cartan involution, and I thought that in order to define some kind of pro-algebraic group associated to general contragredient Lie algebras, I needed integrability. It turns out, though, that by a result of Moody and Pianzola, integrable contragredient Lie algebras are nothing but the symmetrisable Kac-Moody algebras! I should also note that this result of Moody-Pianzola does NOT force the bilinear form on an integrale contragredient Lie algebra to be the usual degree-0 Kac-Moody bilinear form, so the Yangian (and presumably elliptic case as well) can still be covered by the current setup.

29/09/2025: We need a loop/current realisation for the pseudo-fixed-point subalgebras.

06/10/2025: The example section is more or less done, but I'll type it up later, so as to avoid any notational clash.

---//--- BELOW ARE UPDATES ON THE RE-WRITTEN VERSION

13/10/2025: I found a more compact way to express what I wanted to say (and a bit more) in the section on twisted Manin triples, so I rewriting the section from scratch.

14/10/2025:
- I found out that the method I was working on has already been carried out by Schrader for anti-invariant twists in https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5506v2. I will recall this, and then fill in the missing invariant twist case, and then discuss quantisations.
- To go into details a bit, in case I cannot manage to type up all that I want to say before we meet again, I realised that I was focusing too much on whether the automorphism we're twisting by comes from a Dykin diagram automorphism. Your question of whether there were many non-involutive yet still pseudo-involutive automorphisms also prompted me to double-check the papers sequel to the "Kac-Moody pseudo-symmetric pair" paper by Regelskis and Vlaar, and it seems that at the moment, not too many examples beyond the (affine) sl_2 case (so variations of the Onsager algebra) are known explicitly. Given that twisted q-Yangians degenerate to twisted Yangians, which are defined by involutions, I don't suppose that the degeneration process can change a pseudo-QSP into a QSP.
- As for whether the automorphism at play is of type I or II (either meaning that it's conjugate to the Chevalley involution or that it swaps the two subalgebras in a Manin triple), I will keep at the strategy that I was previously pursuing. At least in the trigonometric case, it seems that type-I automorphisms can only twist invariantly while type-II automorphisms can twist anti-invariantly, but I would also like to know how this translates to the rational (and possibly even the elliptic) case.

26/10/2025:
- I was not expecting this, but it seems that an anti-invariant twist can only be done by an involution. One can get coideal subalgebras from non-involutive automorphisms, as in Schrader's paper, but these do not originate from the notion of Manin triple/Lie bialgebra twists by Belliard-Crampé. I'm not yet sure what the correct generalisation of anti-invariant twists to non-involutive automorphisms ought to be. Perhaps, for a finite-order automorphism of order N, one can replace the "-" sign by an N-th root of unity; when N = 2, we regard the -1 factor as a 2nd root of unity.  
- Subsection 1.1 is done.
- Rewriting subsections 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 to fit the rewritten subsection 1.1; the actual mathematics in these 3 sections are essentially done. Subsection 1.5 will depend on how the three above it are written.

18/11/2025:
- I am now faily certain that invariant twists are special instances of gauge (co-gauge ?) transformation of Lie bialgebras (this is dual to gauge transformations of Poisson structures), otherwise known as "classical twists". In Drinfeld's terminology, this is saying that our invariantly twisted Lie bialgebras are examples of Lie quasi-bialgebras. This has a few implications:
    1. quantisations of invariant twists are Drinfeld twists;
    2. invariant twists can be parametrised cohomologically, but the cohomology theory at play is probably nonabelian, though, so I'm not too sure about how to compute the cohomology set parametrising these twists yet;
    3. for affine Kac-Moody Lie bialgebras, these twists can be classified, following works of Abedin et al.;
    4. twisting invariantly respects the Belavin-Drinfeld classification.
- Very roughly speaking, coideal Lie subalgebras are two be thought of as tangent spaces of Poisson homogeneous spaces which are quotients of a (possibly infinite-dimensional) Poisson-Lie (ind-)group by some fixed-point subgroups therein.
    1. We should therefore be able to twist coideal subalgebras invariantly as well, provided that the Poisson structures on these quotients admit any gauge transformation at all.
    2. [...]

23/11/2025:
- I wonder if everything on the quantum side should make up a separate paper of their own, seeing that even in its current very incomplete state, what has been written is already quite long. Namely, I am proposing that the present paper include the following sections:
    1. Generalities about Lie-bialgebraic twists, including connections to Poisson formal groups and Poisson formal homogeneous spaces.
    2. More details about twists of coboundary Lie bialgebras. In particular, I would like to address how boundary classical Yang-Baxter equations/classical reflection equations are derived from anti-invariant twists. I believe that Poisson formal homogeneous spaces are necessary for this.
    3. Compatibility of invariant twists of the standard Kac-Moody algebra Lie bialgebra structure with the Belavin-Drinfeld classification.
Along with technical recollections about Manin triples and Lie bialgebras, I am guessing that the final length of the paper will be no less than 40 pages.
- I am also still somewhat unsure about what a cohomological criterion for the uniqueness of a quantisation of an anti-invariant twist should be. I suspect that this would either be a Hochschild-type cohomology theory for comodules over a topological Hopf algebra, or even just ordinary Ext computation over quantum doubles, but right now I am not sure if these ideas would be equivalent in any rigorous way. This is partly why I think it would be prudent to deal with the quantum side separately, since I suspect that the computations involved will have to be quite meticulous.
- As Dr. Wendlandt suggested, it would be very nice if we can give a cohomological criterion for the uniqueness of twisted Yangians as quantisations of anti-invariantly twisted current algebras, and then deriving a J-presentation for them consequently. This is to be in contrast with the method of Belliard and Regelskis, who "guessed" a J-presentation beforehand (I don't mean to downplay the importance of their work, since I suspect that there aren't that many possibilities for such a guess in the first place) and then proved that - with respect to the Yangian Hopf structure - such a presentation uniquely specifies the twisted Yangians.
