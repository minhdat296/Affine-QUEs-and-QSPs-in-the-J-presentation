28/09/2025: I found out today that integrable contragredient Lie algebras are actually the same as symmetrisable Kac-Moody algebras. This simplifies a lot of the arguments that I was in the process of writing down, so I ended up deleting and rewriting a significant portion. Originally, I was going to define and study the properties of twisted Manin triples for as general of a class of Lie algebras as I can, which I thought was going to be the class of triangular-decomposable Lie algebras. However, I was not sure how to derive generators and relations for pseudo-fixed-point subalgebras at that level of generality led me to narrow my focus down to contragredient Lie algebras. Then, I wanted to define automorphisms of types I and II in terms of whether they lie within the orbit of a Cartan involution, and I thought that in order to define some kind of pro-algebraic group associated to general contragredient Lie algebras, I needed integrability. It turns out, though, that by a result of Moody and Pianzola, integrable contragredient Lie algebras are nothing but the symmetrisable Kac-Moody algebras! I should also note that this result of Moody-Pianzola does NOT force the bilinear form on an integrale contragredient Lie algebra to be the usual degree-0 Kac-Moody bilinear form, so the Yangian (and presumably elliptic case as well) can still be covered by the current setup.

29/09/2025: We need a loop/current realisation for the pseudo-fixed-point subalgebras.

06/10/2025: The example section is more or less done, but I'll type it up later, so as to avoid any notational clash.

13/10/2025: I found a more compact way to express what I wanted to say (and a bit more) in the section on twisted Manin triples, so I rewriting the section from scratch.

14/10/2025:
- I found out that the method I was working on has already been carried out by Schrader for anti-invariant twists in https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5506v2. I will recall this, and then fill in the missing invariant twist case, and then discuss quantisations.
- To go into details a bit, in case I cannot manage to type up all that I want to say before we meet again, I realised that I was focusing too much on whether the automorphism we're twisting by comes from a Dykin diagram automorphism. Your question of whether there were many non-involutive yet still pseudo-involutive automorphisms also prompted me to double-check the papers sequel to the "Kac-Moody pseudo-symmetric pair" paper by Regelskis and Vlaar, and it seems that at the moment, not too many examples beyond the (affine) sl_2 case (so variations of the Onsager algebra) are known explicitly. Given that twisted q-Yangians degenerate to twisted Yangians, which are defined by involutions, I don't suppose that the degeneration process can change a pseudo-QSP into a QSP.
- As for whether the automorphism at play is of type I or II (either meaning that it's conjugate to the Chevalley involution or that it swaps the two subalgebras in a Manin triple), I will keep at the strategy that I was previously pursuing. At least in the trigonometric case, it seems that type-I automorphisms can only twist invariantly while type-II automorphisms can twist anti-invariantly, but I would also like to know how this translates to the rational (and possibly even the elliptic) case.

26/05/2025: I was not expecting this, but it seeems that an anti-invariant twist can only be done by an involution. One can get coideal subalgebras from non-involutive automorphisms, as in Schrader's paper, but these do not originate from the notion of Manin triple/Lie bialgebra twists by Belliard-Cramp√©. I'm not yet sure what the correct generalisation of anti-invariant twists to non-involutive automorphisms ought to be. Perhaps, for a finite-order automorphism of order N, one can replace the "-" sign by an N-th root of unity; when N = 2, we regard the -1 factor as a 2nd root of unity.
