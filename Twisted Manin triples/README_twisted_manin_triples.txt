28/09/2025: I found out today that integrable contragredient Lie algebras are actually the same as symmetrisable Kac-Moody algebras. This simplifies a lot of the arguments that I was in the process of writing down, so I ended up deleting and rewriting a significant portion. Originally, I was going to define and study the properties of twisted Manin triples for as general of a class of Lie algebras as I can, which I thought was going to be the class of triangular-decomposable Lie algebras. However, I was not sure how to derive generators and relations for pseudo-fixed-point subalgebras at that level of generality led me to narrow my focus down to contragredient Lie algebras. Then, I wanted to define automorphisms of types I and II in terms of whether they lie within the orbit of a Cartan involution, and I thought that in order to define some kind of pro-algebraic group associated to general contragredient Lie algebras, I needed integrability. It turns out, though, that by a result of Moody and Pianzola, integrable contragredient Lie algebras are nothing but the symmetrisable Kac-Moody algebras! I should also note that this result of Moody-Pianzola does NOT force the bilinear form on an integrale contragredient Lie algebra to be the usual degree-0 Kac-Moody bilinear form, so the Yangian (and presumably elliptic case as well) can still be covered by the current setup.

29/09/2025: We need a loop/current realisation for the pseudo-fixed-point subalgebras.

06/10/2025: The example section is more or less done, but I'll type it up later, so as to avoid any notational clash.
