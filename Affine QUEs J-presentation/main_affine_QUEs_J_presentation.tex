    \title{The J-presentation for quantum loop algebras}
    
    \author{Dat Minh Ha}
    \maketitle
    
    \begin{abstract}
        We propose a J-presentation for quantum loop algebras and study its compatibility with the other known presentations for said algebras, namely the standard presentation by Drinfeld-Jimbo, Drinfeld's current presentation, and the R-matrix presentation. We seek also to investigate the question of whether or not quantum loop algebras - and hence also quantum affine Kac-Moody algebras - are unique as quantisations.
