\begin{itemize}
    \item If $A$ is an algebra with multiplication $\mu: A \tensor A \to A$ (not even necessarily associativen or unital; e.g. a Lie algebra), then its \textbf{opposite algebra} shall be denoted by $A^{\op}$. This object has the same underlying vector space, but the opposite multiplication is now given by $\mu^{\op} := \mu \circ (-)_{2, 1}$, with $(-)_{2, 1}: A \tensor A \xrightarrow[]{\cong} A \tensor A$ denoting the isomorphism given by $(x \tensor y)_{2, 1} := y \tensor x$.
    \item Likewise, if $C$ is a coalgebra with comultiplication $\Delta: C \to C \tensor C$ (not necessarily co-associative nor co-unital; e.g. a Lie coalgebra), then its \textbf{(co-)opposite} shall be denoted by $C^{\cop}$, the co-opposite multiplication is given by $\Delta^{\cop} := (-)_{2, 1} \circ \Delta$. These notions generalise in a straightforward manner to the setting of topological (co)algebras.
